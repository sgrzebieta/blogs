## What Really is a Technology Disrupter?

We all know about big companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Uber that have disrupted traditional business models, but there are also methodologies and people that can be disruptors too.

For instance, Agile, DevOps, DevSecOps, and SRE are all methodologies that have disrupted traditional approaches to project management, software development, and IT operations. Agile, for example, emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and rapid iteration, while DevOps promotes communication and collaboration between development and operations teams. DevSecOps integrates security practices throughout the software development lifecycle, and SRE focuses on reliability and automation.

But it's not just about methodologies - there are also key people within organizations who can be disruptors. These individuals are change agents or change champions who push back on unnecessary processes and challenge the status quo. By introducing new ideas and questioning established practices, they can drive innovation and positive change within their companies, helping them stay ahead of the competition.

## How can these people lead positive change in a business?    

Individuals who drive change and challenge the status quo within organizations are instrumental in promoting innovation and enhancing operational efficiency. Such individuals are often referred to as "change agents" or "innovators," and they play a critical role in driving innovation and improving processes within their organizations.

One can identify a change agent by looking for certain characteristics. Change agents are typically highly motivated individuals who possess a deep understanding of their organization's operations and culture. They are often willing to take calculated risks and challenge conventional thinking in order to drive change and achieve better outcomes. Change agents may also possess strong communication and leadership skills, which enable them to persuade and influence others to support their ideas.

Furthermore, change agents tend to possess a certain level of resilience, which allows them to persist in the face of obstacles and setbacks. They are not deterred by resistance to change and are adept at adapting to unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, change agents are often self-starters who are not afraid to take the initiative and create momentum for change.

Overall, identifying a change agent can be critical to promoting innovation and improving organizational processes. By recognizing and empowering these individuals, organizations can cultivate a culture of change and continuous improvement that can help them to stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive in today's fast-paced business environment.

## How can you foster the growth of a change agent?

An organization can foster a change agent in several ways, including:

* Encouraging and supporting innovation: Organizations can foster change agents by encouraging and supporting innovative thinking and ideas. They can create a culture that rewards creativity and risk-taking, and provide resources and support for experimentation and new initiatives.

* Providing opportunities for professional development: Organizations can also foster change agents by providing opportunities for professional development and learning. They can offer training and mentorship programs, conferences, and workshops that enable individuals to enhance their skills and knowledge in areas such as leadership and communication.

* Empowering change agents: Organizations can empower change agents by giving them the authority and resources they need to implement their ideas. This can include providing access to budgets, staff, and other resources necessary for successful implementation.

* Recognizing and rewarding success: Organizations can foster change agents by recognizing and rewarding success. This can include acknowledging their contributions through promotions, bonuses, and other forms of recognition, as well as sharing success stories with the wider organization.

* Providing feedback and support: Organizations can also foster change agents by providing feedback and support throughout the change process. They can offer constructive feedback on ideas and initiatives, and provide emotional support to help change agents navigate any challenges they may encounter along the way.

By taking these steps, organizations can foster a culture of change and innovation, and support the development of change agents who can drive positive change and improve organizational performance.

## Why is fostering growth in these type of people Important?

I have firsthand experience with change agents who lose focus, either by circumventing the process, fighting against it, or simply giving up.

Going around the process is not beneficial to anyone, as it is not repeatable. For example, if a business process or procedure prevents you from using the cloud, circumventing it by using your company card to spin up on AWS might seem like a solution, but it's not sustainable.

Fighting the process is also problematic, as it can lead to employee burnout. This can happen when new tools, techniques, or approaches are used against business policy.

Alternatively, some individuals may give up and become just another cog in the wheel, doing their work without trying to innovate.

Using unsanctioned tools, clouds, or going around the process can also pose significant security risks for a business. Without knowing what employees are using, it's impossible to ensure that they are safe to use, compliant with application licenses, or not exposing customer data.

To encourage innovation in a safe and easy way, repeatability is key. One approach is the shark tank method, where teams pitch ideas to a panel, and if they win, they can move forward with a proof of concept. Another way is through hackathons, where teams are given specific areas to improve, such as automating change management, security, deployment, or testing, again the winner is give the opportunity to bring their idea to fruition.

Technology is now at the forefront of every business, and it's essential to embrace it to succeed. While it's not always possible to change everything at once, doing nothing is more dangerous. By not fostering a culture of innovation, you risk signaling that you don't value technology, which is a dangerous notion in this day and age.

## Conclusion  

In the business world, disruption is a critical force that can lead to new opportunities and success, whether it's through innovative methodologies or the people driving change within a company. While some fights may be easier than others, allowing these change agents to thrive can lead to enormous benefits, such as removing paper-based processes that increase business efficiency.
